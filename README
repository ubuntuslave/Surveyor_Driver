This program was developed using Eclipse "Galileo", so it's just as easy to import this project into the IDE.

Otherwise, just go into the "src" folder and compile the shared-object from the command line, by typing:

  $ make

Which will produce a file named "libSurveyor_Driver.so"

You could take this shared object file to any other location if you wish, but try to keep it consistent to the
plugin option in the configuration file named "surveyor.cfg"

To run Player for the SRV-1, just type:

  $ player surveyor.cfg

Enjoy Player on the SRV-1 (tested only on the ARM-7 processor)
Please contribute bug fixes if you wish,
